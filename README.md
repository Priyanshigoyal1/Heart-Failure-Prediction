# Heart-Failure-Prediction
Heart failure is a common event caused by Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and this dataset contains 11 features that can be used to predict a possible heart disease. People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or already established disease) need early detection and management wherein a machine learning model can be of great help.
